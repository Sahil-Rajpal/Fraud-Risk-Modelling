# ðŸ“Œ Credit Risk Modeling

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective  

The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction and customer data, the model helps stakeholders:  

- Detect fraudulent patterns in real-time  
- Minimize financial losses due to fraud  
- Improve trust and security in digital transactions  
- Optimize fraud prevention strategies for financial institutions  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)   
- **Duration Covered:** 1st Jan 2019 â€“ 31st Dec 2020  
- **Scale:**  
  - 1000 customers  
  - 800 merchants  
  - Transactions across multiple categories (e.g., food, travel, shopping, personal care, entertainment, etc.)  
- **Files:**  
  - `fraudTrain.csv` â€“ Training dataset  
  - `fraudTest.csv` â€“ Testing dataset  
- **Features:** 46 columns including:  
  - Transaction details (`trans_date_trans_time`, `cc_num`, `merchant`, `category`, `amt`)  
  - Customer details (`first`, `last`, `gender`, `street`)  
  - Target label: `is_fraud` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)  

The dataset provides a realistic representation of both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, enabling the development of **fraud detection models** that can identify abnormal spending patterns and reduce financial risks.
